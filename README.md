# CS330-PA2PT3
This github repository contains code and output files for the optional component of CS330 PA2 Part 3. The code used to generate the output files is pa2_pt3.py. It was ran under Python version 3.8, and the packages used were sys and heapq. The 3 output files are:

outputrandom
outputdonut
outputzigzag

These three files contain the optimized trees with the TWR and MDR given in my response. The code contains extensive documentation on each of its components. The code can be executed by opening the file from IDLE and then running it. The code will print 9 lines, the format of the print is given below.

random graph TWR
random graph MDR
random graph c used
donut graph TWR
donut graph MDR
donut graph c used
zigzag graph TWR
zigzag graph MDR
zigzag graph c used

The output files will be created in the same folder as the code. Notice that input files must be present in the same folder as the code for the code to run. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to find input files
