# CS330-PA2PT3
This repository contains code and output files for the optional component of CS330 PA2 Part 3.

The 3 output files are: 
  outputrandom
  outputdonut
  outputzigzag

These three file contains the ooptimized trees with the TWR and MDR given in my response.

The file pa2_pt3.py is the code used to generate these files. The code contains extensive documentation on each of its components. 
The code was ran under Python 3.8. The packages used were sys and heapq

The code can be executing by opening the file from IDLE and then running it. The code will print 9 lines, the format of the print is given below.

The output files will be created in the same folder as the code. Notice that input files must be present in the same folder as the code for the code to run. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to find input files
